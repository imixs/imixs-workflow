# The EventLogService

The EventLogService is used to create and manage event log entries within a running transaction.
EventLog entries can be processed by a client in a secure, asynchronous and transactional manner.

Only in case the transaction from the source event was committed successfully, the event log entry can be read by a client. For example the LuceneUpdateService uses an event log entry to update the index only if a transaction was successful completed. This is also known as the 'Change Data Capture' design pattern.

## Change Data Capture (CDC)

An event that occurs during an update or a processing function within a transaction becomes a fact when the transaction completes successfully. The EventLogService can be used to create this kind of "Change Data Capture" events.
For example the LuceneUpdateService should update the index of a document only if the document was successfully written to the database. This can be ensured with the help of the EventLogService.

The service is bound to the current PersistenceContext and stores a EventLog entities directly into the database. An EventLog entry can be queried by clients through this service.

```java
    @EJB
    EventLogService eventLogService;
    ....
        // BEGIN Transaction A
    	eventLogService.createEvent(workitem.getUniqueID(), "MY_TOPIC");
    ....
        // END Transaction A
    .......


    // BEGIN Transaction B
    List<org.imixs.workflow.engine.jpa.EventLog> eventList = eventLogService.findEvents("MY_TOPIC",100);
    for (org.imixs.workflow.engine.jpa.EventLog eventLogEntry : eventList) {
      // the event created in transaction A is no visible...
      ....
    }
    // END Transaction B
```

Typically a new EventLog entity is created within the same transaction of the main processing or update life cycle. With this mechanism a client can be
sure that eventLogEntries returned by the EventLogService are created during a committed Transaction. If the transaction was rolled back for some reason, the EventLog entry will never be written to the database.

## The EventLog Entity

The EventLog entity describes a unique event created during the processing life-cycle of a workitem or the update life-cycle of a Document.

An EventLog is an immutable entity. The object contains the following properties:

- id - identifier for the event log entry
- ref - the reference id of the corresponding workitem or document entity
- topic - the topic of the eventlog
- created - the creation timestamp
- data - an optional data field
- timeout - an optional timestamp indicated the earliest processing time.

The 'data' attribute of an eventLog is optional and can hold any kind of event specific data (e.g. a Mail Message).

**Note:** for the same document reference ($uniqueid) there can exist different eventlog entries. Eventlog entries are unique over there internal ID. You can use the method _findEventsByRef_ to verify if a event log entry for a defined Reference was already created by another transaction.

## The EventLogPlugin

The Imixs Plugin class ` org.imixs.workflow.engine.plugins.EventLogPlugin` can be used to create a EventLog entry during
processing an event. The plugin can be configured by the activity result :

Example:

```
<eventlog name="MY-TOPIC">
	<ref><itemvalue>$uniqueid</itemvalue></ref>
	<timeout>60000</timeout>
	<document>
		<amount>500.00</amount>
		<department>Finance</department>
	</document>
 </eventlog>
```

This definition will create a new EventLog entry with the topic `MY-TOPIC` pointing to the current workitem. The EventLog entry also includes an optional data structure with the items 'amount' and 'department'.

## TransactionID

In different to a document entity, a workitem entity hold a _$transactionID_ identifying the last processing life-cycle. When an eventLog entry is consumed asynchronous, a client may verify the _$transactionID_ item stored in the data field with the last _$transactionID_ stored in the workitem. In case the _$transactionID_ has changed a client can discard the eventLog entry. This mechanism ensures that an eventLog entity is tied to a specific unique transaction only.

For example an AsyncEvent must only be executed if the _$transactionID_ matches the current workitem status.

## Timeout

The optional data attribute _timeout_ of an EventLog entry can be used to delay its execution. The EventLogService method `findEventsByTimeout` can request only eventLogEntries with a timeout indicator which are in due.

# Remote Call

Even from a remote System you can use the Event Log Service to create events. This can be helpful to send asynchron transactional messages to the workflow instance. The following example code uses the [Melman EventLogClient](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-melman) to send an event.

```java
    try {
        // create a new client
        client = new EventLogClient(restAPI);
        client.registerClientRequestFilter(new FormAuthenticator(
                "http://localhost:8080/api",
                userID,
                password));
        // set payload data....
        ItemCollection payLoad = new ItemCollection();
        payLoad.setItemValue("some-data", "abc");
        // send event
        client.createEventLogEntry(
                "TOPIC_INVOICE",
                WorkflowKernel.generateUniqueID(),
                payLoad);
    } catch (RestAPIException e) {
        logger.severe("Failed to send event log entry: " + e.getMessage());
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
```

Through the [Imixs Rest API](../restapi/index.html) you can send a new Event Log entry from any platform.
