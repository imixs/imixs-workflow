# The Workflow Scheduler

The Imixs-Workflow Scheduler is responsible for the automated processing of _scheduled events_. A _scheduled event_ is a BPMN event assigned to a BPMN task. _Scheduled events_ can be used e.g. for a auto reminding or an escalation task.

The Imixs WorkflowScheduler implements a TimerService to process workitems based on _scheduled events_. A _scheduled event_ can be configured, using the [Imixs-BPM Modeler](../modelling/index.html), on the property tab 'Timer'. If a workitem is in a status having scheduled events, the Imixs-Workflow Scheduler will process this workitem automatically based on the event definition.

## The Scheduled Event

A _scheduled event_ can be configured in the property tab 'Timer'.

|           | Description                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enabled   | choose 'yes' to enable a scheduled event (default 'no')                    |
| selection | optional definition to select workitems based on a query or selector class |
| delay     | delay in minutes, hours, days or working days                              |
| from      | base item to calculate the schedule                                        |

**Note:** A scheduled event must define a base datetime item to calculate the schedule.
You can choose a standard datetime item like '$created', '$modified' or '$lastprocessdate' or you can define any datetime item managed by your application (e.g. a due-date or an invoice-date) .

## The Timer Configuration

The _WorkflowSchedulerService_ expects the scheduling configuration document. The scheduling configuration defines the timer interval to run the workflow scheduler.

A timer configuration can be created with the following item definitions:

```xml
<document xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <item name="type">
        <value xsi:type="xs:string">scheduler</value>
    </item>
    <item name="name">
        <value xsi:type="xs:string">org.imixs.workflow.scheduler</value>
    </item>
    <item name="_scheduler_class">
        <value xsi:type="xs:string">org.imixs.workflow.engine.WorkflowScheduler</value>
    </item>
    <item name="_scheduler_definition">
        <value xsi:type="xs:string">hour=*</value>
        <value xsi:type="xs:string">minute=30</value>
    </item>
    <item name="_scheduler_enabled">
        <value xsi:type="xs:boolean">true</value>
    </item>
</document>
```

The Scheduler configuration object can also be created by the _WorkflowSchedulerController_ bean:

```java
@Inject
WorkflowSchedulerController workflowSchedulerController;

public void setup() {
    ItemCollection config=workflowSchedulerController.getConfiguration();
    config.setItemValue("_scheduler_definition", "hour=*");
    config.appendItemValue("_scheduler_definition", "minute=/5");
    workflowSchedulerController.setConfiguration(config);
    workflowSchedulerController.saveConfiguration();
    workflowSchedulerController.startScheduler();
}
```

With the method call startScheduler() the workflow scheduler will be started.

### Scheduling

The _Imixs WorkflowSchedulerService_ uses a calendar-based syntax for scheduling based on the EJB 3.1 Timer Service specification. The syntax takes its roots from the Unix cron utility.
The following attributes can be stored as a value list in the item _'\_scheduler_definition'_:

| Attribute  | Description                           | Possible Values                                                                                                                                                                                    | Default Value |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| second     | One or more seconds within a minute   | [0,59]                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0             |

| start      | Start date                            | yyyy/mm/dd                                                                                                                                                                                         |               |
| end        | End date                              | yyyy/mm/dd                                                                                                                                                                                         |               |

Each attribute of an expression supports values in different formats. For example you can define a list of days or a range of years. The the following table with suported value formats:

| Format       | Description                 | Example                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Single Value | only one possible value     | year="2009" or month="May"              |
| Wildcard     | all possible values         | year="_" or dayOfWeek="_"               |
| List         | two or more values          | year="2014,2015" or dayOfWeek="Sat,Sun" |
| Range        | range of values             | second="1-10" or dayOfWeek="Mon-Fri"    |
| Increments   | startignpoint and increment | minute="\*/15" or second="30/10"        |

So you can configure the scheduler is several ways. Here a some typical exampls for possible configuration:

### Every hour

    hour=*

### Every five minutes with the hour

    minute=*/15
    hour=*

### Every hour from Monday to Friday

    hour=*
    dayOfWeek=1-5

### Every 30 minutes with the hours from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, from Monday to Friday

    minute=*/30
    hour=8-17
    dayOfWeek=1-5

### Only Sunday on 1:00 AM

    hour=1
    dayOfWeek=7

The configuration entity will be updated by the WorkflowSchedulerService in each iteration and provides the following additional information.

| property                 | type        | description                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $uniqueid                | String      | defines the unique ID the for the corresponding TimerService           |
| \_scheduler_definition   | String List | Holds information about the calendar based scheduling                  |
| \_scheduler_enabled      | Boolean     | indicates if the scheduler is enabled                                  |
| \_scheduler_logmessage   | String List | message log (read only)                                                |

| \_scheduler_status       | String      | current status (read only)                                             |
| \_scheduler_class        | String      | read only must be set to "org.imixs.workflow.engine.WorkflowScheduler" |
| nextTimeout              | Date        | Timestamp for next timeout (read only)                                 |
| timeRemaining            | Long        | milliseconds until next timeout (read only)                            |

## Selector

The workitems processed by the scheduler are selected by a default selector based on the $TaskID and the $workflowgroup.

    ($taskid:"[TASKID]" AND $workflowgroup:"[MY-WORKFLOWGROUP]")

The selector can be overwritten by a BPMN event. For example the workflow group can be replaced by the modelversion to select only a subset of process instances:

    ($taskid:"[TASKID]" AND $modelversion:"1.0.0")

### Custom QuerySelector

An application can implement a _QuerySelector_ CDI bean to provide a custom selection of scheduled workitems. The full qualified class name of a QuerySelector can be used instead of a search query.

    myapp.selectors.MyCustomSelector

If a _QuerySelector_ is defined, the WorkflowScheduler tries to inject the selector CDI Bean and calls the find method to select the workitems to be scheduled.

### Ignored Workitems

The _WorkflowSchedulerService_ processes all kinds of workitems which are assigned to a valid workflow model definition with scheduled events.
A workitem is ignored by the _WorkflowSchedulerService_ only in case the workitem type ends with the sufix 'deleted'

    type=workitemdeleted

or the workitem is marked as immutable

    $immutable=true

See the [DocumentService](./documentservice.html) for details.
