# Taxonomy Plugin 

The Imixs Taxonomy plugin can be used to collect taxonomy data at specific stages of a business process.

```java
org.imixs.workflow.plugins.TaxonomyPlugin
```

The plugin can be used to collect data about the processing time of a certain phase within the life cycle of a process instance. Several individual taxonomy definitions can be configured in the workflow result of a BPMN event:


### Example:

```xml
    <taxonomy name="approval">
    	<type>start</type>
    	<anonymised>true</anonymised>
    </taxonomy>
```   

defines a start point named 'approval'

```xml
    <taxonomy name="approval">
    	<type>stop</type>
    	<anonymised>true</anonymised>
    </taxonomy>
```    

defines the end point named 'approval'. 

## Taxonomy Data 

Defining a taxonomy within the model will result in the following workitem properties based on the name of the taxonomy:

  * taxonomy.name : contains a list of all collected taxonomy names (e.g. 'approval')
  * taxonomy.[NAME].start : contains the start time points in a list (latest entry on top!)
  * taxonomy.[NAME].end : contains the end time points (list)
  * taxonomy.[NAME].duration: contains the total time in seconds
  * taxonomy.[NAME].start.by: contains the $owner list at the first start
  * taxonomy.[NAME].end.by: contains the $editor list at the last stop
  
**Note:** [NAME] will be replaced with the name of the taxonomy definition. It is possible  
 to define several measuring points in one process model.
  
The following diagram illustrates two taxonomy definitions in a ticket-workflow:

The first taxonomy definition 'P1' will measure the total processing time for a ticket. The second taxonomy definition 'P2' will measure the duration of the processing time (in seconds) for accepting the ticket.


### Anonymised Data

Per default the taxonomy plugin generates anomymised data entries. This means there is no reference to the user who started or stopped specific stages of a business process.

You can disable this GDPR feature by setting the tag `anonymised` to `false`:

```xml
    <taxonomy name="approval">
    	<type>stop</type>
    	<anonymised>false</anonymised>
    </taxonomy>
```
