# The Imixs-BPMN Modeler - User Guide

Imixs-BPMN is a free modelling tool to create process models for the Imixs-Workflow framework. Imixs-BPMN takes the full advantage of all the capabilities from the BPMN standard and complements them with the requirements to a workflow management system. Imixs-BPMN is based on the Open Source project [Open-BPMN](https://www.open-bpmn.org) and extends this framework with the aspects of a human-centric workflow model executable on the Imixs-Workflow Engine. 

To install Imixs-BPMN please see the [Installation Guide](./install.html). The section [Overview](./overview.html) provides general information about how you can use the Imixs-BPMN modelling tool.
