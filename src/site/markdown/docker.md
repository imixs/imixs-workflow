# Imixs Docker

The Imixs-Workflow project supports several Docker Images to run Imixs-Workflow in a containerized infrastructure.
The Imixs Docker Images are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/imixs/) and can be installed and extended in various ways.

## The Imixs Microservice

The subproject [Imixs-Microservice](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-microservice) provides a WebService Interface which can be used to interact with the Imixs-Workflow-Engine over the [Imixs Rest API](./restapi/index.html). The 'Imixs-Microsoervice' is a Java EE Web Module which extends the Imixs-Workflow Engine providing a Rest Service for Human Centric Workflow Applications. This service can be used as a single Microservice or bundled with a Java EE Business Application. See also the [Deployment Guide](./deployment/index.html) for details.

## How to run a Imixs Docker Container

To use Imixs-Workflow out of the box, you can create a 'docker-compose' file:

    version: '3.3'
    services:
      db:
        image: postgres:9.6.1
        environment:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: adminadmin
          POSTGRES_DB: workflow
      app:
        image: imixs/imixs-microservice
        environment:
          WILDFLY_PASS: adminadmin
          POSTGRES_HOST: "db"
          POSTGRES_USER: "postgres"
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "adminadmin"
          POSTGRES_DATABASE: "workflow"
          POSTGRES_CONNECTION: "jdbc:postgresql://db/workflow"
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"

Run start imixs-wokflow with docker-compose run:

    $ docker-compose up

**Note:** The container is linked to the postgres container providing a database name 'workflow'. See the [docker project home](https://hub.docker.com/r/imixs/imixs-microservice/) for more information.

## Testing the Imixs-Microservice

Using the command-line tool '[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)' makes it easy to test the Imixs-Microservice. Here are some examples.

**NOTE**: As Imixs-Workflow is a human-centric Workflow Engine only authenticated users (Actors) can interact with the engine. Therefore it is necessary to authenticate against the Imixs-Rest service API. Imixs-Microservice provides a User-Management-Service to register and authenticate users. The default user has the userid 'admin' and the default password 'adminadmin'. This user is used in the following examples.

### Deploy a new BPMN model

With the following command a BPMN model created with the [Imixs-BPMN Modeling Tool](./modelling/index.html) can be deployed into the Imixs-Microservce.

    curl --user admin:adminadmin --request POST \
    	-Tticket.bpmn \
    	http://localhost:8080/imixs-microservice/model/bpmn/

### Request the Deployed Model Version

The following command returns the model versions deployed into the service:

    curl --user admin:adminadmin -H \
    	"Accept: application/xml" \
    	http://localhost:8080/imixs-microservice/model/

### Request the Task List

To request the current task list for the user 'admin' run:

    curl --user admin:adminadmin -H \
    	"Accept: application/json" \
    	http://localhost:8080/imixs-microservice/workflow/tasklist/creator/admin

### Create a new Process Instance

The next example shows how to post a new Workitem in JSON Format. The request post a JSON structure for a new workitem with the txtWorkflowGroup 'Ticket', the ProcessID 1000 and ActivityID 10. The result is a new process instance controlled by Imixs-Workflow Engine

    curl --user admin:adminadmin -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json"  -d \
    '{"item":[
            {"name": "$modelversion", "value":["1.0"]},
            {"name": "$taskid", "value": [1000] },
            {"name": "$eventid", "value": [10] },
            {"name": "_subject", "value": ["some data...","more data..."]}
         ]}' \
        http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/workitem

### Read a Process Instance

After posting a new process instance the Imixs-Workflow engine will retrun a datastructure includign the uniqueid of the created process instance.
The uniqueid is used to request a single Workitem from the Imixs-Microservice. See the following curl example to request a workitem by it's $UniqueID in JSON format:

    curl --user admin:adminadmin -H \
    	"Accept: application/json" \
    	http://localhost:8080/imixs-microservice/workflow/workitem/14b65352f58-259f4f9b

This example returns the content of the Workitem with the UniqueID '14b65352f58-259f4f9b'. You can also restrict the result to a subset of properties when you add the query parameter 'items':
