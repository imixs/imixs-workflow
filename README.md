Imixs-Workflow is an open source workflow engine based on the Java Enterprise Architecture (JEE). The Imixs-Workflow project provides components to build human-centric workflow applications within a flexible and robust framework. The business logic can be modeled and executed using the Business Process Modelling Notation - BPMN 2.0 standard.

You will find more detailed information how to work with Imixs-Workflow on the [Project Home](http://www.imixs.org). 

## Imixs-BPMN
Imixs-BPMN is an Eclipse modeling tool to design a business process based on the BPMN 2.0 standard. These models can be executed by the Imixs-Workflow engine.

## Imixs-RESTful API
Imixs-Workflow provides a RESTful API to integrate the Imixs-Workflow engine into a microservice architecture. In such an architecture the Imixs-Workflow engine can be deployed as a separate microservice managing human-centric workflow tasks. The Imixs-Microservice project also includes a Docker Container to setup the workflow engine in a few minutes. See the [Imixs-Microservice project](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-microservice) for more information.
